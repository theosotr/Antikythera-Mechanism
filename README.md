Antikythera-Mechanism
=====================

An emulator of Antikythera's Mechanism in two distances

Application also runs on the below URL:
http://theosotr.github.io/

Executes the following operations:
1) Lunisolar operation which activates all mechanism's gears that are responsible for the Callipic Calendar, Metonic Calendar and Olympiad output.
2) Lunar operation which activates all mechanism's gear that produce Sidereal Month output.
3) Eclipse operation which activates all mechanism's gears that produce Exeligmos and Saros output.
4) Moon Phase operation which activates all mechanism's gears that produce the moon phase output.
5) Back Dial operation which shows the back dial of the mechanism. It also activates all mechanism's gears that are responsible for the output of back dial.
6) Front Dial operation which shows the front dial of the mechanism. It also activates all mechanism's gears that are responsible for the output of front dial.
7) All gears operation which activates all mechanism's gears. 

This repository includes the following files:
 
-A folder for the Mechanism 's sketch files, which includes pde files representing one class each. It 's the code for the Lunisolar, Lunar, Eclipse,
Moon phase, Back Dial, and All Gears operations.

-A folder for the Front Dial's sketch files, which includes pde files representing one class each and it's the code for the Front Dial operation.
(I have added the above folders on this repo in order code reading to be much easier as pde files are seperated).

-A folder which includes Mechanism and Front Dial sketch in one pde file as well as the processing.js file in order application to be run on the browser.


It is preferable to run application on Firefox.
